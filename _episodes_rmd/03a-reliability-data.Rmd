rawdata <- read_csv("data/TDashboardData_reliability_20160301-20160331.csv")
View(rawdata)
```



```{r}
rawdata %>% 
  filter(PEAK_OFFPEAK_IND == "Peak Service (Weekdays 6:30-9:30AM, 3:30PM-6:30PM)", ROUTE_TYPE=="Green Line" ) %>% 
  select(-c("SERVICE_DATE","ROUTE_TYPE","STOP","OTP_NUMERATOR","OTP_DENOMINATOR")) %>% 
  #Remove and extra spaces
  mutate(STOP = str_trim(STOP))
