#### First steps - Prepare the data

* We are now going to prepare our reliabitliy data for analysis and mapping by: 
  * filtering it by type of service, 
  * creating a reliability metric based on a calculations of two variables in our datset, 
  * and then pulling in latitude and longitude for stops from another dataset.  
* Many say 60-80% of the work in a data science project is spent in preparing the data for analysis 

To begin let's read in the datasets we will need to work with. This will be two:

1. `TDashboardData_reliability_20160301-20160331.csv` downloaded via mbta online
2. `mbta_stations.csv` provided by ...



```r
#read in MBTA performance csv file
rawdata <- read_csv("data/TDashboardData_reliability_20160301-20160331.csv")
```

```
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   SERVICE_DATE = col_character(),
##   PEAK_OFFPEAK_IND = col_character(),
##   MODE_TYPE = col_character(),
##   ROUTE_OR_LINE = col_character(),
##   ROUTE_TYPE = col_character(),
##   STOP = col_character(),
##   METRIC_TYPE = col_character(),
##   OTP_NUMERATOR = col_double(),
##   OTP_DENOMINATOR = col_double()
## )
```

```r
stations <- read_csv("data/mbta_stations.csv")
```

```
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   OBJECTID = col_double(),
##   STATION = col_character(),
##   LINE = col_character(),
##   TERMINUS = col_character(),
##   ROUTE = col_character(),
##   LONGITUDE = col_double(),
##   LATITUDE = col_double()
## )
```

```r
#View(rawdata)
#View(stations)
```

We first want to work with the reliability data, e.g. `rawdata`. Here are the steps we want to perform on `rawdata`:

1. Take `rawdata` and pipe through `filter()`
1. Filter by peak service (weekday rush hour)
1. Filter by only the green line
1. Mutate to create or overwrite a variable 
1. str_trim to remove whitespaces before and after values
1. Create a rely variable that 
1. Finds the reliability at each station
1. Divides the numerator (people who have to wait too long) by the denominator (all riders).
1. This is the percentage of people who had to wait. 1 - this ratio is the percentage of people who didn't.
1. drop the columns we don't need for futher analysis


```r
rawdata %>% 
  filter(PEAK_OFFPEAK_IND == "Peak Service (Weekdays 6:30-9:30AM, 3:30PM-6:30PM)", ROUTE_TYPE=="Green Line" ) %>% 
  mutate(STOP = str_trim(STOP), rely = 1 - OTP_NUMERATOR/OTP_DENOMINATOR, rely = round(rely, 4))
```

> ## Why did we select the ROUTE_TYPE instead of the ROUTE_OR_LINE?
>
> We are interested in the Green Line. Do both fields include the Green Line? If so, are there any differences?
>
> > ## Solution
> > Answer: Looking at the data frame, you can see that in the ROUTE_OR_LINE field, the B, C, D, and E branches of the Green Line are listed separately. Whereas in ROUTE_TYPE, the Green Line has the same name for each branch. We do not need the specific branch for this analysis. Therefore, we will use the ROUTE_TYPE field. Note: You might discover that we need the specific branch to answer a question in the future. In this case, you will have to go back and edit your R program. This iterative process occurs often in data wrangling, and is another reason to write good comments as you program.

> ## What is happening in the `mutate()` function? 
> There are two variables that are created: `STOP` and `rely`.
> 1. What does `str_strip` do?
> 2. How is `rely` defined? HINT: Look at the Data Dictionary < https://massdot.app.box.com/v/dashboard-data-dictionary> again.
> 
>> ## Solution
>> 1. `mutate` creates new variables in the dataframe, but we can also use it to overwrite existing ones. `str_strip` from the stringR package strips trailing and leading white spaces. So we are running that function on `STOP` to clean out white spaces and then over-writing it on itself. 
>> 2. `rely` comes directing from the Data Dictionary: 
>> “Passenger wait time” for rail means the numerator reflects passengers who waited too long, so numerator/denominator= % pass. waiting too long ; subtract from 1 to get % pass. waiting acceptable amount of time



## Adding Geolocation data to the dataframe via another table

* The lat/long data is in mbta_stations.csv 
* Import the MBTA station location data
* We will set up our dplyr sequence taking `stations` and passing it thru funcitons
* Select only the Green Line data


locs <- stations[which (stations$LINE=='GREEN'),]

# Change the name of Station to Stop to match the other dataframe
colnames(locs)[2] <- "STOP" 
View(locs)


# Join the location data to the reliability file
joindata <- merge(x = reliability, y = locs, by ="STOP", all.x=TRUE)

#Select only the columns need
joindata <- joindata[c("STOP","SERVICE_DATE","ROUTE_TYPE","rely","LONGITUDE","LATITUDE")]
x = !duplicated(joindata$STOP)
joindata <- joindata[x ,]
View(joindata)
