## What? - Demo how tidycensus works to bring data in from the Census

* Kyle Walker's [tidycensus](https://github.com/walkerke/tidycensus) R package makes it easy to bring census data into R as a dataframe.

* We'll walk through how this works in practice.  
* Before this package existed, you'd need to find and extract or download the census data prior to reading into R as a dataframe. 

## First steps

* Before running code like the following from tidycensus, you need to [obtain an API key](http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html) from the Census and then use the function `census_api_key()` to set it in R.
* Let's look at California population data by country.

california_pop <- get_acs(geography = "county", 
                     variables = "B01003_001", 
                     state = "CA",
                     geometry = TRUE) 
~~~

* The total population in each county in California, in a tidyverse-ready data frame.
* If you want to get information for multiple states, [just use purrr](https://walkerke.github.io/2017/05/tidycensus-every-tract/). 
* The US Census tabulates lots of [important kinds of information](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/subjects.html) in the United States.

* So we have this data in a form that will be easy to manipulate; what if we want to map it? 
* Kyle Walker again has this taken care of, with his `tigris` package (a dependency of tidycensus); if you set `geometry = TRUE` the way that I did when I downloaded the Census data above, `tigris` handles downloading the shapefiles from the Census, with support for `sf` [simple features](https://github.com/edzer/sfr). 
* Kyle has a vignette for [mapping using ggplot2](https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/articles/spatial-data.html), but you can also pipe straight into leaflet.

**What is that `st_transform` doing?**

* It is doing a projection onto a certain reference system of the spatial information contained in the `sf` column.
* The specific choice of an [EPSG code of 4326](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/3334/what-is-the-difference-between-wgs84-and-epsg4326) is for a given projection.

## A couple more examples

* Let's look at the counties in Utah (where I live) while we're at it. Let's map color to population here, instead of quantiles, just for something different.

utah_pop <- get_acs(geography = "county", 
                    variables = "B01003_001", 
                    state = "UT",
                    geometry = TRUE)

pal <- colorNumeric(palette = "plasma", 
                    domain = utah_pop$estimate)

utah_pop %>%
    st_transform(crs = "+init=epsg:4326") %>%
    leaflet(width = "100%") %>%
    addProviderTiles(provider = "CartoDB.Positron") %>%
    addPolygons(popup = ~ str_extract(NAME, "^([^,]*)"),
                stroke = FALSE,

* Utah is largely an extremely rural state, with lots of people  in Salt Lake City and then in the corridor to the north and south.

* There is so much other information available from the Census. For example, what if I want to look at the median home value in Salt Lake County, at the census tract level?

* The two census tracts with `NA` values are the airport on the west side and the University of Utah on the east side. You can very obviously see the east-to-west gradient 
* and that priciest tract is up against one of the canyons with beautiful views. But mainly please notice with what ease I made this interactive map!
