## Motivation

* This lesson will teach you how to start this process using
R and RStudio. 
* We will begin with raw data, perform exploratory analyses, and learn
how to plot results graphically. 

## Before Starting The Workshop

* Please ensure you have the latest version of R and RStudio installed on your machine. 

## Introduction to RStudio


* We'll be using RStudio: a free, open source R integrated development
environment. 
* It provides a *built in editor*, works on all platforms (including
on servers) and provides many advantages such as integration with version
control and project management.



**Basic layout**

When you first open RStudio, you will be greeted by three panels:

  * The interactive R console (entire left)
  * Environment/History (tabbed in upper right)
  * Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (tabbed in lower right)

![RStudio layout](../fig/01-rstudio.png)

Once you open files, such as R scripts, an editor panel will also open
in the top left.

## Work flow within RStudio
There are two main ways one can work within RStudio.

1. Test and play within the interactive R console then copy code into
a .R file to run later.
   *  This works well when doing small tests and initially starting off.
   *  It quickly becomes laborious
2. Start writing in an .R file and use RStudio's short cut keys for the Run command
to push the current line, selected lines or modified lines to the
interactive R console.
   * This is a great way to start; all your code is saved for later
   * You will be able to run the file you create from within RStudio
   or using R's `source()`  function.

> ## Tip: Running segments of your code
>
> RStudio offers you great flexibility in running code from within the editor
> window. There are buttons, menu choices, and keyboard shortcuts. To run the
> current line, you can 
> 1. click on the `Run` button above the editor panel, or 
> 2. select "Run Lines" from the "Code" menu, or 
> 3. hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> in Windows or Linux 
> or <kbd>&#8984;</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> on OS X.
> (This shortcut can also be seen by hovering
> the mouse over the button). To run a block of code, select it and then `Run`.
> If you have modified a line of code within a block of code you have just run,
> there is no need to reselct the section and `Run`, you can use the next button
> along, `Re-run the previous region`. This will run the previous code block
> including the modifications you have made.

## What are R packages? {#packages}

* Another point of confusion with new R users is the notion of a package. 
* R packages extend the functionality of R by providing additional functions, data, and documentation and can be downloaded for free from the internet. 
* They are written by a world-wide community of R users. 
* For example, among the many packages we will use

* `ggplot2` package for data visualization
* `dplyr` package for data wrangling

There are **two key things** to remember about R packages:

1. *Installation*: Most packages are not installed by default when you install R and RStudio. You need to install a package before you can use it. Once you've installed it, you likely don't need to install it again unless you want to update it to a newer version of the package.
1. *Loading*: Packages are not loaded automatically when you open RStudio. You need to load them every time you open RStudio using the `library()` command.

A good analogy for R packages is they are like apps you can download onto a mobile phone:

R: A new phone           |  R Packages: Apps you can download
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![](../figure/02-engine.jpg){ height=1.5in } |  ![](../figure/02-dashboard.jpg){ height=1.5in }

So, expanding on this analogy a bit:

1. **R is like a new mobile phone**. It has a certain amount of functionality when you use it for the first time, but it doesn't have everything.
1. **R packages are like the apps** you can download onto your phone, much like those offered in the App Store and Google Play. For example: Instagram. 
1. In order to use a package, just like in order to use Instagram, you must:
    1. First download it and install it. You do this only once.
    1. Load it, or in other words, "open" it, using the `library()` command.

### Package installation

There are two ways to install an R package. For example, to install the `ggplot2` package:

1. **Easy way**: In the Files pane of RStudio:
    a) Click on the "Packages" tab
    a) Click on "Install"
    a) Type the name of the package under "Packages (separate multiple with space or comma):" In this case, type `ggplot2`
    a) Click "Install"  
     ![](images/install_packages_easy_way.png){ height=4in }
1. **Alternative way**: In the Console pane run `install.packages("ggplot2")` (you must include the quotation marks).

Repeat this for the `dplyr` and `nycflights13` packages.

**Note**: You only have to install a package once, unless you want to update an already installed package to the latest version. If you want to update a package to the latest version, then re-install it by repeating the above steps.

### Package loading

After you've installed a package, you can now load it using the `library()` command. For example, to load the `ggplot2` and `dplyr` packages, run the following code in the Console pane:


~~~
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
~~~
{: .language-r}

**Note**: You have to reload each package you want to use every time you open a new session of RStudio.  This is a little annoying to get used to and will be your most common error as you begin.  When you see an error such as

```
Error: could not find function
```

remember that this likely comes from you trying to use a function in a package that has not been loaded.  Remember to run the `library()` function with the appropriate package to fix this error.
